title: Getting Started with PROS

## Should I use PROS?
Since you're here and reading our documentation, the answer is most likely yes! However, PROS (and C programming in general) can be difficult for a lot of beginners, so it may not be the ideal solution for everyone.

If you find yourself saying the following things often:

* "I don't want to actually learn to code, I just want some code to make my awesome mechanical design move!"
* "I'm not sure I like coding, but that PROS Editor's dark theme though..."
* "Reading documentation is for losers, I'm sure I can get my code working with trial and error!"

...then PROS may not be the best choice for programming your robot.

But if you're one of the lovely people who says the following things:

* "Writing code may not be easy, but I'm determined to put in the effort required to write great code!"
* "I want to pursue a future career writing software (or doing any sort of STEM, really)."
* "I already know how to write C code for non-VEX applications, and I want something similar for VEX."
* "I'm dead-set on using my favorite text editor for VEX code."
* "I have this grand plan for writing the most feature-packed, complex code ever implemented on a VEX robot and I need a programming environment that can support that."

...then PROS is just right for you!

## Awesome! I want to use PROS -- what next?
PROS is C programming. It's not "based on C" or "similar to C", it's just a set of functions to be used with the exact same C programming language that is used outside of VEX applications. As a result, familiarizing yourself with standard C concepts is a must for writing code with PROS. Find a good C tutorial ([we recommend this one](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html)) and familiarize yourself with C programming before jumping right into writing code. If you run into issues later, consulting these tutorials and other C references will likely help you solve any issues you may have with your code.
